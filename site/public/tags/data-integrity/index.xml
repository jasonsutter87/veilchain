Today, Merkle trees are the gold standard for proving that data hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with—and for good reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-merkle-tree">What Is a Merkle Tree?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Merkle tree is a hash-based data structure that allows efficient and secure verification of large data sets. Think of it as a cryptographic receipt for your data that makes tampering immediately detectable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merkle Tree Ledger for Tamper-Proof Audit Logs | VeilChain</title><link>https://veilchain.io/blog/2024-12-14-introducing-veilchain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2024 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veilchain.io/blog/2024-12-14-introducing-veilchain/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce the launch of VeilChain, an open-source merkle tree ledger service designed to bring Bitcoin-grade data immutability to your applications. VeilChain provides tamper-proof audit logs and cryptographic data integrity without the overhead of running a full blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-data-integrity-without-blockchain">The Problem: Data Integrity Without Blockchain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modern applications need verifiable data integrity. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re building immutable audit logs for compliance, document notarization systems, or supply chain tracking, you need cryptographic proof that data hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
