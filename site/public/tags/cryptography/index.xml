Today, Merkle trees are the gold standard for proving that data hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with—and for good reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-merkle-tree">What Is a Merkle Tree?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Merkle tree is a hash-based data structure that allows efficient and secure verification of large data sets. Think of it as a cryptographic receipt for your data that makes tampering immediately detectable.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
